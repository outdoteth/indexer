// Whenever an order changes its state (eg. a new order comes in,
// a fill/cancel happens, an order gets expired, or an order gets
// revalidated/invalidated due to a change in balance or approval
// we might want to take some actions (eg. update any caches). As
// for events syncing, we have two separate job queues. The first
// one is for handling direct order state changes (cancels, fills
// or expirations - where we know the exact id of the orders that
// are affected), while the other is for indirect change of state
// - where we don't know the exact ids of the affected orders and
// some additional processing is required (eg. on balance changes
// many of the orders of a maker might change their state).
